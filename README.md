# libraryApp
Creation of simple library application by using objects and constructors

- All book objects are being stored in an array
- A function loops through the array and displays each book on the page within individual cards
- The "+" buttons displays a modal that contains a form which can be used to create a NEW BOOK
    - If you don´t wanna create a new book by now, you can close the form by pressing "ESC" and all changes will be discarded
- You can TOGGLE the status between read and not read by pressing the button
- You can DELETE a book whenever you want, but remember THIS CAN´T BE UNDONE!!!
